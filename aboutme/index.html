    <h2>Noah Evans</h2>
    <p> Hello! I’m Noah Evans, a software engineering student at BYU-Idaho. When not studying, I enjoy pickleball and spending time with my family, watching our favorite show, Survivor. My wife and I are excitedly expecting our first child, a girl, this June. The welcoming community at BYU-Idaho, especially coming from Mesa, Arizona, has made it a second home for me.</p>
    <p> I'm studying web design to complement my engineering skills, aiming to create intuitive and aesthetically pleasing software solutions. This course will help me understand user interface design and enhance user experiences in my future projects.</p>
    <p>I’ve been a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, drawing great strength from its teachings. One of my favorite scriptures is Proverbs 3:5-6, which encourages trust and faith in divine guidance for all life's paths. This principle guides both my personal and professional life.</p>
